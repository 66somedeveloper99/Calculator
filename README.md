# JCalculator

**api** :

Calculator:
constructors:
	```Calculator(String calculation);```
	calculation is the actual calculation you want to calculate.
public methods:
	```double calculate(int debug_level)```
	returns the calculated value in double.
	debug_level = 0: nothing printed during calculation.
	debug_level = 1: only simplifications are printed.
	debug_level = 2: all behind the scenes are printed.

	```double calculate()```
	returns the calculated value in double.
	and nothing printed during calculation.
	
public variables:
	```boolean IS_SOLVABLE;```
	if solvable, returns true; otherwise false.


BigCalculator:
constructors:
	```BigCalculator(String calculation);```
	calculation is the actual calculation you want to calculate.

public methods:
	```BigDecimal calculate(int debug_level)```
	returns the calculated value in BigDecimal.
	debug_level = 0: nothing printed during calculation.
	debug_level = 1: only simplifications are printed.
	debug_level = 2: all behind the scenes are printed.

	```BigDecimal calculate()```
	returns the calculated value in BigDecimal.
	and nothing printed during calculation.

public variables:
	```boolean IS_SOLVABLE;```
	if solvable, returns true; otherwise false.


**usage** :

write
```
Calculator cal = new Calculator("12+3/2");
```
to declare a calculation variable. (you can choose your own equation instead of "12+3/2" ).

to check whether it's solvable or not:
```
if(cal.IS_SOLVABLE)
```

to write the equation:
```
system.out.println(cal.calculate());
```
it returns a double variable, so you cal also consider it as a new variable:
```
double r = cal.calculate();
```

BigCalculate is the same, only that it returns a BigDecimal instead of a double. so you can do the same thing with BigCalculate with only difference being to change the ```double r``` to ```BigDecimal r```.
